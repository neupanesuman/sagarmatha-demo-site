    <h1>What our student says</h1>
    <p>Entering college, I assumed that my professors were
      teachers who would
      pour their vast knowledge and understanding into me, an
      eager and willing pupil. I
      entered with expectations of challenging, thought
      altering course work and
      stimulating lectures. I envisioned understanding things
      I could never grasp before.
      It was not that I was excited just by the idea of
      learning new information; I was
      excited also to be taught by experts.</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="Testimonials-col">
        <img src="photo/u2.jpg">
        <div>
          <p>Fortunately, I did craft an understanding of
            how to get the most out of my
            college experience, and as a recent
            graduate, I realize that the processes and
            skills
            advocated in this essay for learners are
            vital to life after college</p>

          <p>Finally, I want to stress that it was the
            teacher, not the subject, school, or
            delivery method, that made classes
            interesting and made learning more effective
            for
            me. Regardless of teaching styles or
            preferences, those courses that I finished
            with
            a sense of accomplishment and meaningful
            knowledge.</p>
